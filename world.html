            We welcome you to the CREATION NETWORK. We've identified 15 towns in this great country. The tentacles of the benefactor stretch wide and deep. In these towns we will start anew. Opposition is to be expected. However, we are protected. These lands will be what we make of them. You are welcome here. Bring you people. All things that you have lacked in your life, you will find in abundance.  LOVE- RESPECT - HONOR.
            </p>  <p>  
            3000 acres of American land now belong to the network with over 10,000 acres being surveyed. Octavius was not convinced that land and monies would be giving to the black lives of this country, so he used his wealth and influence to gather like minded individuals to build ths community. You are most welcome to join us. <br>
