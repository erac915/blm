            <p class="has-dropcap">Indeed. Black lives do matter, indeed they do. Today only one black life mattered. The life of his son, Octavius. Octavious was already a stubborn child although he has yet to breathe this polluted air. Already two weeks overdue, he seemed to be keenly aware of the face that no blanket would be able to shield him from the cold and harsh realities of the world he would be born into. The only warmth he was sure to received would be that of hi mother, Yebba and his father, Surran. 

            When he did arrive, he didn’t make a sound. He held a stern expression s if to say “did I ask to be rescued?” He look perturbed. The doctor and nurses alike were stunned by the display. After the initial shock of his demeanor, a calmness felt on the room. 
            </p><p>
            Later that evening, while Octavius was in the nursery, Dr. Fauntleroy explained to  Surran and Yebba how he felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria when he held Octavious fo the first time. “First, congratulations again on your ne bundle and your amazing delivery” Dr. Faunt (as he liked to be  called ) said in a seemingly anxious voice. “Lisen I just want to tell you that there his something special about your child and although Im a doctorr=, I can’t tell you what that is. What I can say is that when I held him, he didn’t;t feel fragile. It was as if her= had total control of his limbs, his eyes focus on mine and he liked through me and I felt my insecurities fade.  I often feel peace when I delivery a hold. This time I felt empowered and blissful. </p>
