            <p class="has-dropcap">Black lives do matter, indeed they do. Today only one black life mattered. The life of his son, Octavius. Octavious was already a stubborn child although he has yet to breathe this polluted air. Already two weeks overdue, he seemed to be keenly aware of the fact that no blanket would be able to shield him from the cold and harsh realities of the world he was born into. The only warmth he was sure to received would be that of his mother, Yebba and his father, Surran. 

            When he did arrive, he didn’t make a sound. He held a stern expression as if to say “did I ask to be rescued?” He look perturbed. The doctor and nurses alike were stunned by the display. After the initial shock of his demeanor, a calmness felt on the room. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Later that evening, while Octavius was in the nursery, Dr. Fauntleroy explained to Surran and Yebba how he felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria when he held Octavius for the first time. “First, congratulations again on your the birth of your son amazing delivery” Dr. Faunt (as he liked to be called) said in a seemingly anxious voice. “Listen I just want to tell you that there his something special about your child and although I'm a doctor, I can’t tell you what that is. What I can say is that when I held him, he didn't feel fragile. It was as if he had total control of his limbs, his eyes focused on mine and as he looked through me and I felt my insecurities fade.  I often feel peace when I delivery a hold. This time I felt empowered and blissful."
