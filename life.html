            <p class="has-dropcap">We know what you're expecting. You're expecting the grfft. You're expecting a grand deception. You may even want be a part of the dismantling of the system. We are not destruction. We do not want the whole of the black American people to march and set fire to every city they inhabit. Fortunately for us, we are reborn. We have new beliefs that encompass and surpass the tenets of “The American Dream”. We make no demands. We make no threats. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              Through our benefactor and his tentacles we finally have learned the language of this land. We now have the means to particpate at a higher level. All pieces are in place. We do not seek equality as the term implies inferiority. And while the black American was in fact inferior in this land, we know that was not our proper inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider the life you want. We do not offer a life without struggle but we do offer a place of renewal. Can you imagine it? A place where you voice can and will be heard. <br><mark class="blue">This is where you life will begin</mark>
